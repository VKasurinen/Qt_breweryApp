# QML test project


I had no experience with QML or Qt tools. However, I have a lot of experience with Android development. The Android side of the small project was really easy and it took me maybe 30 minutes to do it. But integrating QML into the project and getting it working was much more challenging and I couldn't finish it properly. However, I managed to finish it with jetpack compose.

At first I read and looked at google and also documents on how to use QT tools with Android and watched a video on how to integrate it with a finished project in Android Studio. This went without a problem. The problems only came after this, because the QML code didn't want to build. Maybe I had misunderstood, because I was trying to make a bridge between mainactivity and QML the whole time. Maybe it should have been done so that the mainactivity only uses QML code and ready-made Qt components.

My own experience: 2/5
