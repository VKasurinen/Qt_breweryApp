# QML test project

At first I looked at some documentation about the api, Qtquick for Android and QML related things. After that I started doing the assignment.

I used MVVM structure in this project and the data - domain - presentation layer setup was very easy and done in like 30min, 
but combining the android kotlin code with QML wasn't so easy and I tried different ways but always have some kind of build issues or something else.
